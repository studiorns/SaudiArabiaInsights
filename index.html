                    <li>At 95.40%, Saudi Arabia has near-universal awareness of Abu Dhabi, indicating market saturation for basic awareness.</li>
                    <li>The +2.40pp year-over-year growth suggests continued improvement despite already high levels.</li>
                    <li>Marketing focus should shift from basic awareness to differentiation and consideration, as nearly everyone already knows about the destination.</li>

                    <li><strong>Not Value for Money (35%, +14pp)</strong>: The significant increase is concerning and suggests deteriorating value perception. Marketing should emphasize value propositions and potentially develop value-oriented packages.</li>
                    <li><strong>Other Places to Visit (29%, +18pp)</strong>: The substantial increase indicates growing competition from alternative destinations. Marketing should emphasize Abu Dhabi's unique differentiators and experiences unavailable elsewhere.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not Much to Do (24%, -1pp)</strong>: This perception remains relatively stable. Marketing should continue to highlight the diversity of activities and experiences available in Abu Dhabi.</li>
                    <li><strong>Too Expensive (24%, -14pp)</strong>: The significant decrease is positive, suggesting improved price perception.

                    <li>The preference for luxury and upper upscale properties suggests that Saudi Arabian travelers researching Abu Dhabi are primarily from the upper-income brackets.</li>
                    <li>The relatively low interest in midscale properties indicates an opportunity to better position value offerings to this market, potentially addressing the "Not Value for Money" barrier.</li>
